A Deep Learning ECG Algorithm for Prediction
of Atrial Fibrillation and Major Adverse
Cardiovascular Events in Individuals without
Prevalent Cardiovascular Disease

# Abstract:

The electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart which is undergoing a
continuous depolarization-repolarization cycle. Medical professionals currently use the ECG to assess
and diagnose certain cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias and ischemic events.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death of worldwide and the growing sedentary lifestyle
will only further deteriorate the situation. Cardiovascular health is now more relevant than ever and
early detection of disease signs would improve the quality of life for millions of individuals.
Although, doctors show a high accuracy on diagnostic prevalent conditions, especially for common
affections such as atrial fibrillation, prediction of incident diseases is a challenging task for the human
eye. Risk factor models have been developed to track incident cardiovascular disease types, but they
rely on human-made features and so may prove to be sub-optimal.
Machine learning and deep learning models have made tremendous progress in the last decade, with
many medical applications currently in development. Convolutional neural networks, a deep learning
model, have shown great applicability to dynamic images, such as the ECG, and have proven
competent on detecting prevalent cardiovascular diseases with a high accuracy.
The challenge now lies into creating deep learning models for the prediction of prevalent diseases.
Current research shows progress in developing algorithms on 1-lead and 12-lead ECGs for both
detection and prediction, but problems persist on the architecture of the network and the dataset size.
This project is focused on developing a convolutional neural network architecture based on data
provided by the UK Biobank. The projectâ€™s main objective is to analyse if training a neural network on
exercise stress test (stationary bicycle test) data enhances the prognostic value of at-rest ECGs. The
targeted incident affections in this study are atrial fibrillation and major adverse cardiovascular events.
